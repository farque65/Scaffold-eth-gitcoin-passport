# üèó Scaffold-ETH Gitcoin Passport

## About this Branch
This branch of [Scaffold-Eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) gives you a jumping off
point for using [Gitcoin Passports](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) in your dapp. This can also be used
to simply learn about Passport scoring.
For your convenience, there is a hosted version [here](https://lucianhymer.github.io/Scaffold-eth-gitcoin-passport).

## Hosted Demo
This app is hosted in GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://lucianhymer.github.io/Scaffold-eth-gitcoin-passport).
This is a great resource to see how passports and scoring work before cloning this repo to build your dapp.
Work with the passport on the first tab and configure scoring parameters on the second tab.
